# The Pragmatic Programmer presentation slides

## Overview

My attempt to summarize selected topics from "The Pragmatic Programmer" book by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in presentation slides used in 2-hour long workshop for my team. I don't have any connection to the authors and the content is based on my interpretation.

I mostly focused on design and soft skills, ommitting more technical topics like algorithm complexity and concurrency that would require a dedicated workshop to cover them sufficiently. Slides mostly contain tips from the book with some points coming from other sources. Slides are spiced up with relevant memes.

I also included three challenges marked as "challenges" in the slide to encourage discussions and debates about some of the design aspects.

## Format and source

Slides were created in markdown with Marp, the source included in [slides.md](slides.ml).

The final version is exported to pdf format [slides.pdf](slides.pdf).
